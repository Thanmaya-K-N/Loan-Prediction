## Project Overview

The LoanPredictor project utilizes the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict loan eligibility. By training the model on historical loan data and relevant features, it determines whether an applicant should be granted a loan based on predefined criteria. The project aims to streamline the loan approval process for lenders and provide accurate predictions.

## Key Features

- Logistic Regression model for loan eligibility prediction
- Feature selection based on credit score, income level, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio
- Data preprocessing for cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables
- Model training and evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Decision boundary to classify loan applicants into approved or rejected categories
- Recommendations for loan approval based on prediction results
- Continuous improvement by incorporating new data and recalibrating the algorithm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thanmaya-K-N/LoanPrediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your loan application data in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2. Replace the placeholder dataset with your own data.
3. Run the prediction script:

   ```bash
   python predict_loan.py
   ```

4. View the predicted loan eligibility for each applicant.

## Dataset

The LoanPredictor project utilizes a historical loan dataset that includes information about loan applicants and their loan status (approved or rejected). This dataset serves as the basis for training and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.

## Model Training

The Logistic Regression model is trained on the historical loan dataset using the scikit-learn library. The features selected for training include credit score, income level, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio. The model is optimized to make accurate predictions based on these features.

## Evaluation

The performance of the LoanPredictor model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting loan eligibility. The evaluation results help assess the model's effectiveness and can guide any necessary improvements.
